# Week 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: When you log into the blue server, you could use burp or hackertool to look up the session ID. After opening a different web browser(chrome and firefox were used) and going back to the public site of the blue server. You could now look up and change the session ID from the second browser to make it match the first browser.  After changing it, you should already be logged in by navigating to a different page within the blue server site.

## Green

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): When in the Public Site, click on "Find a Salesperson" tab.  Click a random salesperson and then inspect the url.  You'll notice the url has an 'id=9' at the end which calls out to different people. Changing the 9 (or any number) to a different number will enable you to find addtional salespeople not listed in the public site.
