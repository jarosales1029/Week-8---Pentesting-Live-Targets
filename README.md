# Week 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1 - Session Hijacking/Fixation: When you log into the blue server, you could use burp or hackertool to look up the session ID. After opening a different web browser(chrome and firefox were used) and going to the public site of the blue server. You could look up and change the session ID of the second browser to make it match the session ID of the first browser. After changing it, you should be logged in under the same permissions. You could navigate to different pages within the site to verify.

Vulnerability #2 - SQL Injection (SQLi): When in the public site, click on the "Find a Salesperson" tab. Click on a random salesperson and then inspect the url. You'll notice the url has an 'id=4' at the end; this calls out to different people. Even if it fails, you could change the 4 to a sql injection attack and you'll notice that it does a query. I was able to get a return off of 'or''='. [SQLi](https://github.com/jarosales1029/Week-8-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/Week%208%20-%20Blue%20SQLi.gif)


## Green

Vulnerability #1 - Username Enumeration: When in the login page, you could type in a username you already know such as, "pperson", and a wrong password.  The result is a bold error message.  When attempting it again by typing a random username and password, the result will be a message that is not in bold.

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): When in the public site, click on the "Find a Salesperson" tab. Click on a random salesperson and then inspect the url. You'll notice the url has an 'id=9' at the end; this calls out to different people. Changing the 9 (or any number) to a different number will enable you to find addtional salespeople not listed in the public site. [IDOR](https://github.com/jarosales1029/Week-8-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/Week%208%20-%20Red%20IDOR.gif)
