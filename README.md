# Week 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: 

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): When in the Public Site, click on "Find a Salesperson" tab.  Click a random salesperson and then inspect the url.  You'll notice the url has an 'id=9' at the end which calls out to different people. Changing the 9 (or any number) to a different number will enable you to find addtional salespeople not listed in the public site. [IDOR] ()

Vulnerability #2: __________________
